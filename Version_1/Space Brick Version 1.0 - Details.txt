SPACE BRICK VERSION 1.0 (Produced January, 2017)

This was my first attempt at creating a 2D video game in Java from Scratch. It
is built using a custom-built lightweight game engine, and features a number of
experimental versions of standard gameplay features. Core to Space Brick 1.0 is
the inclusion of a relative screen rendering system. Its greatest weakness is 
the fact that the collision system is extremely inefficient and breaks if 
objects don't move in set increments.

All art assets are custom desgined and painstakingly drawn using Paint.NET.

Source code is included as an Eclipse Project (Oxygen Dec 2017).
