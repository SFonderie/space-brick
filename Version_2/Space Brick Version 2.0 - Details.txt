SPACE BRICK VERSION 2.0 (Produced May 2018)

In this iteration, made for an AP Computer Science A final project,
the underlying game engine has been fully revamped and reorganized,
as well as fully documented. The newer engine is far more efficient
and user friendly than the original, and makes better use of object
oriented methodology than the first version. Like the first version,
however, collision is still rudimentary.

In this version, an enemy unit has been added in, all sprites are now
64-bit, new weapons have been added, and the level now has complete
bounds.

Settings (and user control over them) took a step back in this iteration
due to time constraints (there wasn't enough time to add the settings
back into the new engine given the time I had to work on my final).

Art assets are still painstakingly produced using Paint.NET.

Source code is included as an Eclipse project (Oxygen Dec 2017).
